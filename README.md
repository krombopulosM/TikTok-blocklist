# TikTok blocklist
just a list of domains and regex I've curated from scraping the website/app and other online sources. As a warning this is *NOT* for blocking ads/trackers, this *WILL* block any association with TikTok

the regex is added at the top of the list, you can enter that manually into your blocklist. If there is a domain you think is missing or should not be included please comment and I will consider adding/removing it.
